# Plan: catching up to OrbStack

[**English**](./plan.md) | [简体中文](./plan.zh-CN.md)

A step-by-step plan to close the gap to OrbStack on **both speed and experience**. Each
milestone is independently shippable, has a measurable parity target, and says how we verify it.
We do them roughly in order; speed/efficiency basics first, then experience, then the hard
filesystem moat last.

> Baseline numbers come from `bench.sh`. Re-run it after each milestone to track progress.

## Status (M1–M8)

| | Milestone | Status |
|---|---|---|
| M1 | Golden image / instant restart | ✅ verified |
| M2 | zram (kernel-tier efficiency) | ✅ verified |
| M3 | Active memory ballooning | ✅ verified |
| M4 | Dev filesystem guidance | ✅ done (docs) |
| M5 | Networking | 🟡 partial — DNS-following + port-forward verified e2e; `oorb route` + full netstack pending |
| M6 | Kubernetes (k3s) | ✅ verified — `kubectl get nodes` → Ready in the e2e suite |
| M7 | Multiple machines | ✅ verified — `machine create`+`exec` green in the e2e suite |
| M8 | Native menu-bar GUI | ✅ builds & launches (UI not visually verified headless) |
| M9 | Native-speed filesystem | ⛔ not started (the hard moat) |

## Phase 0 hardening — what the verification push found & fixed

A long verification push turned the suite from chaos into a reliable 9/12 and
root-caused the real reliability bugs (all fixed, see git log):

1. **Binary signing** — `oorb` only codesigned the VZ binary when it *built* it;
   any rebuild left it unsigned → VZ refused to boot (`VZErrorDomain Code=2`).
   This was the core "VM won't boot" cause. Now `bin()` always re-signs.
2. **Bash 3.2 array crash** — `oorb start` aborted on stock macOS bash whenever
   k8s wasn't enabled (empty array under `set -u`). Fixed with the 3.2-safe
   expansion.
3. **`machine exec`** — ran `docker exec` over the host socket, which loses
   hijacked-stream output; now routed through the guest agent.
4. **Guest agent hangs** — the exec port could wedge under load (un-timed-out
   commands leaking fds + a busy-loop on accept errors). Added per-command
   timeouts, concurrency caps, accept backoff, and a raised fd limit.
5. **The big one — memory ballooning** (`MemoryManager`): it squeezed the VM to
   `used+384MiB`, clamping a 4GB guest to ~730MiB when idle, so a container
   burst OOM-killed dockerd and the agent. *This was the "degrades under load"
   instability.* Fixed with a 2GB floor, proportional headroom, and hysteresis
   (deflate fast, reclaim slow). Verified: a 30-container churn that used to
   kill the agent in ~5 runs now survives all 30.

**Known residual:** fresh-boot non-determinism — docker/the agent occasionally
take >5min to come up, or container egress is slow for ~60s, on some boots. It's
**not reproducible on demand** (most boots are fine) and worsened over
consecutive boots while host load stayed low, pointing at VZ/host-side
degradation after hours of heavy create/destroy cycling rather than a logic bug.
Re-verify from a fresh host state (reboot).

**Sharper repro (2026-05-26 run):** a **cold boot from the golden image is fast
and reliable** — `oorb start` was ready in ~8.8 s and `docker run`, VirtioFS,
Rosetta, machines, zram, ballooning and DNS-follow all passed. The failures
cluster on **booting/restarting a *mutated* `disk.img`** (after heavy cycling, or
the `k8s enable` stop→start on a freshly-k3s-written disk): the guest kernel comes
up (vsock RSTs the connection) but **dockerd + the guest agent never start**, so
graceful stop can't ACPI-poweroff and falls back to force-kill. Separately, on one
golden boot **container egress failed while dockerd's own image *pull* succeeded**
— i.e. the guest host has internet but the docker0 NAT/MASQUERADE path for
containers didn't come up, which also blocks port-forward and k3s CNI. Net: cold
golden boots are trustworthy today; **the unsolved Phase-0 work is reliable
restart-on-a-written-disk + deterministic docker0 NAT bring-up.** `oorb reset`
(restore golden) is the reliable recovery.

**Durability fixes since:**
6. **Disk-level lock** (the named next fix) — the engine now takes an exclusive
   `flock` on the disk image before boot (`DiskLock`), so two VMs can never write
   the same image at once (the concurrent-writer ext4 corruption that broke later
   boots). Auto-released by the kernel on exit, so a crash leaves no stale lock.
7. **`oorb start` fails fast** — if the engine exits early (locked disk, VZ boot
   refusal, …) the wrapper now detects the dead process and prints the real error
   from `vm.log` immediately, instead of polling for 5 minutes and reporting a
   generic timeout.
8. **Durable stop — the restart-on-a-mutated-disk fix (2026-05-27, verified).**
   Root cause was a doom loop: ACPI graceful stop stalled when dockerd/systemd
   were busy → host timed out and `kill -9`'d the VM mid-write → corrupted the
   ext4 image → next boot's dockerd + agent never started → stop force-killed
   again. Broken at the source: the guest agent now serves a **vsock shutdown
   port (2378)** that `sync`s the fs and does a graceful `systemctl poweroff`
   with a **sysrq `s`/`u`/`o` fallback** (sync, remount-ro, power off — needs
   neither systemd nor acpid). `VMManager.requestStop` prefers that path and only
   falls back to ACPI if the agent is unreachable. cloud-init persists
   `kernel.sysrq=1` and bakes `fsck.repair=yes` into GRUB so a disk left dirty by
   any earlier crash self-heals on boot. `tests/e2e.sh` now has a
   **restart-on-a-mutated-disk** case (stop <28 s = no force-kill, then Docker
   must come back on the restarted disk) — green; a healthy stop now powers off
   in ~1 s via the agent.

**Remaining Phase-0 residual — intermittent docker0 NAT bring-up.** The 2026-05-27
e2e run hit it (container egress/DNS/port-forward red) while dockerd's own pull
succeeded; a manual reboot immediately after showed MASQUERADE + `ip_forward=1`
all correct. It's a **boot-ordering race**: `docker.service` (After/Wants
network-online.target) activates at the same second network-online is reached, so
dockerd sometimes installs its nft NAT rules before the NIC/route fully settles.
Next fix: order docker.service strictly after the NIC is up, or add an
`ExecStartPost` that verifies/re-applies the MASQUERADE rule.

## Reassessment — the real gap to OrbStack

Building M1–M8 changed the picture. The biggest gap is **no longer a single missing
feature** — it's that the **foundation isn't rock-solid yet**, and a chunk of work is
**written but not proven**:

- **Reliability:** the build effort repeatedly hit VM boot / first-boot-provision timeouts,
  force-kills that corrupted the disk, and stuck build processes holding SwiftPM/Go locks that
  cascaded into hangs. OrbStack just-works; openorb still sometimes won't boot. This is the
  most painful practical gap.
- **Unverified work:** `oorb route` (M5), k3s (M6), machines (M7) are code-complete but never
  ran end-to-end — and M7 shipped with a real bug that only surfaced when a stale verification
  task finally completed. *Code that hasn't run doesn't count.*
- **Maturity:** the GUI (M8) is a menu-bar stub; there's no packaging/distribution; the
  filesystem moat (M9) is untouched.

The gaps fall into three buckets:

**A. Foundation (stability & trust) — the current top blocker**
1. Boot/provision reliability: `oorb start` must *always* come up, shutdown must never corrupt
   the disk, no lock cascades.
2. Prove the written work: real end-to-end green for M5 route, M6 k3s, M7 machines (+ fix bugs).
3. An automated e2e test suite (start→docker→mount→rosetta→port→k8s→machine→stop), CI-gated, so
   "unverified commits" can't happen again.

**B. Performance (truly *fast*)**
4. Custom minimal kernel + direct boot → cold start ~8 s down to ~1–2 s (OrbStack-level).
5. **M9 filesystem moat** — own virtiofs caching/DAX (likely a custom VMM on
   `Hypervisor.framework`). Small-file from ~21× toward native. The only research-hard piece.

**C. Product (truly *nice*)**
6. Full GUI (containers/images/volumes/logs/machines/k8s/settings), not a menu-bar stub.
7. Networking depth: VPN *traffic* routing (gvproxy), container-by-IP, `*.oorb.local` domains.
8. Packaging: signed + notarized `.app`, dmg / brew cask, Sparkle auto-update.

## Path forward — Phase 0 → 1 → 2

> Reordered from the original M-sequence: **harden the foundation first**, then performance,
> then product. Continuing to pile on features before Phase 0 just builds on sand.

**Phase 0 — Foundation hardening (do first)**
- 0.1 Root-cause and fix boot/provision reliability (EFI delay? cloud-init apt stalls? lock
  contention?); target a stable <10 s start; graceful-only shutdown; `oorb start` self-heals.
- 0.2 `make verify` end-to-end suite + CI; red on any failure.
- 0.3 Verify & harden M5 route / M6 k3s / M7 machines to real green.

**Phase 1 — Performance**
- 1.1 Custom compiled minimal kernel + direct boot → ~1–2 s start.
- 1.2 (the moat) M9 self-built virtiofs caching/DAX → near-native files. Hardest, most expensive, last.

**Phase 2 — Product**
- 2.1 Full SwiftUI app (multi-panel).
- 2.2 gvproxy netstack (VPN traffic + container IPs + domains).
- 2.3 Signed/notarized `.app` + brew cask + auto-update.

**Bottom line:** matching OrbStack's *speed* ≈ Phase 1.2 (research-hard, months, likely a custom
VMM). Matching its *reliability and polish* ≈ Phase 0 + Phase 2 (large but ordinary engineering).
**Do Phase 0 next** — not M9.

|---|---|---|---|
| CPU virt / Rosetta | ✅ | ✅ at parity | — |
| Docker / ports / egress / DNS resolve | ✅ | ✅ | — |
| Cold start | ~1–2 s | ~30–60 s first / ~3–6 s reuse | **M1, M2** |
| Memory footprint | dynamic + zram | fixed, no zram | **M3** |
| Bind-mount small files | ~native | ~21× slower | **M4** (mitigate), **M9** (match) |
| VPN traffic / container IPs | ✅ | DNS only | **M5** |
| Kubernetes | one-click | none | **M6** |
| Multiple machines | ✅ | single VM | **M7** |
| GUI | native app | CLI only | **M8** |

---

## M1 — Instant restart (golden image)
- **Goal:** `oorb start` on an already-provisioned disk in **≤ 3 s**; provisioning never reruns.
- **Tasks:** make `oorb build-image` produce a fully-provisioned "golden" disk (boot once, let
  cloud-init finish, snapshot); `oorb start` reuses it read-fast; keep a pristine copy so resets are cheap.
- **Verify:** `time oorb start` ≤ 3 s; `docker run hello-world` immediately after.
- **Effort:** 🟢 small · **Risk:** low · **Deps:** none.

## M2 — Fast boot + custom kernel
- **Goal:** cold boot toward OrbStack's ~1–2 s; a kernel we control.
- **Tasks:** build a kernel **inside the guest** (native arm64 — no macOS cross-compile pain),
  monolithic (virtio-blk/net/fs, vsock, ext4, overlay, **zram** all `=y`); boot it via VZ
  **direct-kernel-boot** (`--kernel`, already supported) instead of EFI; strip unused drivers.
- **Verify:** `uname -r` shows the custom kernel; boot time measured in `bench.sh`; VM still
  passes the full Docker/VirtioFS/Rosetta/port-forward suite.
- **Effort:** 🟡 medium · **Risk:** medium (getting a bootable `.config` may take a few tries) · **Deps:** none.
- **Unlocks:** zram builtin (M3), tuning, faster boot.

## M3 — Memory efficiency (zram + ballooning)
- **Goal:** low idle footprint; reclaim memory on demand like OrbStack.
- **Tasks:** enable **zram** swap (builtin from M2); add an **active ballooning** loop on the host
  that reads guest memory pressure and adjusts the VZ balloon target; optional **KSM** for
  cross-container page dedup.
- **Verify:** idle RSS drops materially; many small containers run without hogging RAM.
- **Effort:** 🟡 medium · **Risk:** medium · **Deps:** M2 (for zram).

## M4 — Dev filesystem, pragmatic
- **Goal:** make mounted-source dev usable now (without the full M9 rewrite).
- **Tasks:** an `oorb` helper + docs for the named-volume workflow (keep `node_modules`/build dirs
  on the guest's own disk); investigate any guest-side caching knob; **add small-file + real
  workload (`npm install`) cases to `bench.sh`**.
- **Verify:** documented workflow gets `npm install` close to native; bench shows the win.
- **Effort:** 🟢 small–medium · **Risk:** low · **Deps:** none.

## M5 — Seamless networking (user-space netstack)
- **Goal:** VPN **traffic** routing, container/machine reachability by IP, optional domain names.
- **Tasks:** integrate a user-space netstack (e.g. **gvisor-tap-vsock / gvproxy**) so guest
  traffic flows through macOS (following VPN routes), with a unified bridge.
- **Verify:** a container reaches a VPN-only host; ping a container IP from macOS.
- **Effort:** 🔴 large · **Risk:** medium · **Deps:** none (DNS resolution already follows the Mac).

## M6 — Kubernetes
- **Goal:** one command to a working cluster.
- **Tasks:** run **k3s** in the guest; project the kube API (vsock tcp-forward → `localhost:6443`);
  write/merge a kubeconfig; `oorb k8s enable/disable`.
- **Verify:** `kubectl get nodes` and a sample deployment from macOS.
- **Effort:** 🟡 medium · **Risk:** low–medium · **Deps:** M5 nice-to-have (service networking).

## M7 — Multiple Linux machines
- **Goal:** OrbStack-style named, multi-distro machines on the shared kernel.
- **Tasks:** manage multiple rootfs images; `oorb machine create/list/delete/exec`; per-machine
  mounts/networking; one SSH/exec multiplexer.
- **Verify:** create an Ubuntu and an Alpine machine, exec into each, files isolated.
- **Effort:** 🔴 large · **Risk:** medium · **Deps:** M2 (shared custom kernel helps).

## M8 — GUI
- **Goal:** a native app experience, not just CLI.
- **Tasks:** a **SwiftUI** app wrapping the engine — status/menu-bar, containers, machines, logs,
  settings, start/stop; bundle the `openorb` engine + guest agent.
- **Verify:** install the `.app`, manage everything from the UI.
- **Effort:** 🔴 large · **Risk:** low (engineering, not research) · **Deps:** M6/M7 for full surface.

## M9 — The moat: native-speed filesystem
- **Goal:** match OrbStack's ~75–95% native bind-mount speed (vs ~21× slower today).
- **Tasks:** the hard part — VZ's stock VirtioFS exposes no cache/DAX tuning, so we need our own
  **virtiofs server with caching/batching (+ DAX if possible)**. That likely means dropping VZ's
  high-level API for a **custom VMM on `Hypervisor.framework`** (so we control the device models).
  This is the deepest, most expensive piece — OrbStack's real moat.
- **Verify:** `bench.sh` small-file within ~2× of local disk; `npm install` on a bind mount near native.
- **Effort:** 🔴🔴 very large (research-hard, multi-month) · **Risk:** high · **Deps:** ideally after M1–M8.

## Milestone vs phase

The M1–M9 detail above is the original feature breakdown (M1–M8 now built; see Status). The
**Phase 0 → 1 → 2** plan is what we actually execute next, after the reassessment: Phase 0 turns
the built-but-shaky foundation into something trustworthy, then Phase 1 (incl. M9) chases real
speed, then Phase 2 the product surface. See the [research report](../orbstack-research.md) for
the OrbStack deep dive.
